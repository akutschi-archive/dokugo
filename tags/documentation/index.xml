      <description>Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to configure your site. The configuration is done in the config.toml file. This file is located in the root of your Hugo project. After creating the directories like explained in the installation step your directory and file structure should look like the following one:
$ tree demodokugo/ demodokugo/ ├── config.toml &amp;lt;----- The configuration file ├── content └── themes Overview The whole config.toml file is the following one:</description>

      <description>Default Folders The basic idea is that your content folder has three subfolders, the section folders:
 blog for blog articles, documentation for the content of several topics and projects for the description of projects.  Each folder can contain other folders. For example, the project folder can have folders for a Raspberry Pi cluster project, a home cinema project and an art project. Each project folder can contain multiple articles written in Markdown.</description>

      <description>Here we are not running hugo manually to create and publish the site as in the manual deployment. Instead we use GitHub Actions and publish on GitHub Pages.
Configuration For a successful deployment we have to adjust the config.toml. Just replace the baseURL with the correct URL.
baseURL = &amp;#34;https://username.github.io/repository/ Here you find some information for different types of GitHub Pages sites. The type decides which baseURL you have to use.</description>

      <description>This is even simpler than the deployment with GitHub. It&amp;rsquo;s just one file in the project root to run GitLab CI/CD and to deploy on GitLab Pages.

baseURL = &amp;#34;https://username.gitlab.io/repository/ Here you find some information for the different domain names for GitLab Pages. The type decides which baseURL you have to use.</description>
