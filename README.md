## Preview Theme with `exampleSite` Content

If you want to test this theme just clone this repository with

```
git clone git@github.com:akutschi/dokugo.git
```

and then

```
cd exampleSite
hugo server --themesDir ../../
```

Browse site on http://localhost:1313.
Or just visit https://akutschi.github.io/dokugo.

## Quick Start

### Requirement

Hugo minimum version: `0.69`

### Download

Create a folder that holds your project and there a folder called `content`. Assuming that `git` is installed just initialize Git and simply clone this repository as submodule into your themes folder:

```bash
mkdir -p <SITENAME>/content
cd <SITENAME>
git init
git submodule add git@github.com:akutschi/dokugo.git themes/dokugo
```

Now we have created a new Hugo site, initialized a git repository and added the theme as submodule to our site.

### Configuration and Content

Now we add the [configuration file](https://akutschi.github.io/dokugo/documentation/dokugo/configuration/) and the [content](https://akutschi.github.io/dokugo/documentation/dokugo/content/) from the example site to get started.

```bash
cp -r themes/dokugo/exampleSite/content/* ./content/
cp themes/dokugo/exampleSite/config.toml ./
```

### Start
Start the built-in Hugo web server with `hugo server` to check the page:

```bash
$ hugo server
Start building sites â€¦
